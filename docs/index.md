# Welcome to Bookshelf Documentation

Bookshelf is a **learning project** for building REST APIs and writing **clear, easy-to-understand documentation**.

## About This Project

This project builds **two small REST APIs**, one after the other. Each API teaches different things, but they both work with books and use the same basic structure.

### Project Goals

1. Learn Python by working with books
2. Build simple REST APIs
3. Write clear documentation that people can understand

## The Two APIs

### API 1 – Open Library Explorer

The first API uses Open Library data that's been saved locally. This helps you work with real, messy data and learn to document an API when you don't control the data.

### API 2 – Personal Library API

The second API works with a personal book collection. This helps you design an API when you own the data and can add stricter rules.
