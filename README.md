# Bookshelf

I‚Äôm learning Python by working with data from a small home book collection and using tools to organize, analyze and document it.

## Research Question

This project looks at whether authors‚Äô publication dates show any real patterns or are just spread out randomly. It uses simple tools to analyze the book data and spot any trends in when authors published.

## Tools (*add versions here)
- LibreOffice Calc ‚Äì storing & organising data  
- Python & JupyterLab ‚Äì EDA
- GitHub ‚Äì version control  
- Markdown & MkDocs ‚Äì documentation  

I hope to contribute to open source GitHub projects in the future.

## Project process & learning goals

### Input
Collate data into a CSV file with five columns:  
   - `book_title`  
   - `author`
   - `author_nationality`  
   - `first_published`  
   - `page_count`  
   - `genre`

Learn a little bit about GitHub version control

### Handling
Learn how to use Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for basic EDA 
   - Load the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
-Data structure: Dictionary
   - Check columns, data types and missing values.
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps (explore variable types, strings)
   - Analysis techniques (algorithms or functions applied)

üîç Analysis Possibilities
book_title (Search by title, count duplicates & keyword analysis)
author (Grouping by author & most prolific authors)
first_published (Time trends, earliest/latest books & historical filters)
page_count (Average/min/max page stats & filtering by size)
author_nationality (Diversity analysis & regional trends)
genre (Popular genres, multi-genre grouping & filtering)

   - Clean or transform data as needed.
   - Do my best to adhere to PEP 8 and other best practices along the way

### Output
   - Test hypothesis by finding & explaining significant descriptive statistics (if any) in publication dates
   - Test hypothesis by finding & explaining significant visual patterns (if any) in publication dates
   - Create a GitHub site to show documentation, using MkDocs

## Notes Tagging System

Use one-word tags in the `notes` column to describe content or context. Examples: `classic`, `sci-fi`, `nature`, `unknown`, etc.
